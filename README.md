Hello,
this project is a  secure communication system using RSA, AES, and HMAC encryption techniques, implementing client-server architecture with OTP-based authentication.

Features:
End-to-End Encryption – Ensures secure data transmission using AES encryption.
Public-Key Authentication – Uses RSA for key exchange between client and server.
Message Integrity – Implements HMAC verification to prevent tampering.
One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication – Adds an extra layer of security.
Cross-Platform Compatibility – Runs on Linux & Windows.
